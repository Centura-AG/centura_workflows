# Version Tag Workflow

This repository contains GitHub Actions workflows

## Workflow: `version-tag-workflow.yaml`

### Purpose
This workflow extracts the version number from the specified Python package directory and creates a new Git tag if it does not already exist.

### Location
```
.github/workflows/version-tag-workflow.yaml
```

## Inputs
The workflow is designed to be reusable using `workflow_call`. It accepts the following input:

| Name          | Description                                         | Required | Type   | Default          |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------|--------|------------------|
| package_path | Path to the package directory containing `__init__.py` | âœ…        | string | `my_repo_name`   |

## Permissions
The workflow requires `contents: write` permission to create and push tags.

## Usage Example
This workflow can be used in another repository as follows:

```yaml
name: Version Tag Creator

on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'my_repo/__init__.py'
    branches:
      - 'develop'

jobs:
  call-version-tag-workflow:
    uses: Centura-AG/centura_workflows/.github/workflows/version-tag-workflow.yaml@develop
    permissions:
      contents: write
    with:
      package_path: ${{ github.event.repository.name }}
```

## Requirements
- The target repository must contain a Python package with an `__init__.py` file where `__version__` is defined.
- The workflow should be triggered when a relevant change is made to the `__init__.py` file.
- Ensure `contents: write` permission is granted to allow tag creation.
